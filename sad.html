            <h2>feeling sad?</h2>
            <p>
                Ask yourself, what has got you down? This feeling sucks, yes, but it’s always important to ask yourself simple questions in order to understand this emotion. Nobody wants to be upset; but this is something we all face and unfortunately can never avoid. In saying that, everything is a chance for you to experience, learn and develop yourself more. Let yourself be sad. Do not fight your emotions. Allow your mind to be down in this time in order to get over this feeling not only faster, but more secure. Some may say to go for a walk or something along the lines of physical activity, and if that helps you then go ahead! But it can be acknowledged that, that may not be for everyone. Remember to take care of yourself - at the very least. Drink some water, cry your heart out, cuddle your pillow, stare at a wall… or do anything that might cheer you up, even if it’s the tiniest bit, it still counts.
