                Trying to decide something? Or is something currently messing with your head? Suppose you’ve already tried to figure it out. If you’ve done everything in your power to understanding your situation and or maybe it is not something that can happen in this given moment - all you can do is give it time. Time not only heals, but also gives the answer to everything eventually. Waiting can be incredibly annoying, especially if you do not have the patience; but good things come to those who wait because everything happens for a reason, you just don’t know why yet.
