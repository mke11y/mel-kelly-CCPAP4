            <h2>feeling angry?</h2>
            <p>
                Mad, huh? Yeah, understandable. Probably should try your best to step away from whatever is causing you harm, you don’t want to make it worse. That is most likely the best thing for you at the moment. Take a breather, get some food if you can stomach it, a sip of water and do something that would make you happy. Talk to a friend, rant on social media, write in a journal and then rip it out OR maybe even just have a nap. You need a break from everything, allow yourself to come back and face the situation that is causing you distress when you’re in a clear and steady headspace.
